# Scientific_papers_classification

Due to limited resources, I run the task on google colab.

"Prdiction_of_subjects_of_scientific_papers.ipynb" file contains all the code for Machine Learning task and data analysis.

"requirements.txt" file contains all the important libraries (to be installed) required to run the .ipynb file. Please upload the requirements.txt file and zip data file to the google colab and press run all.
